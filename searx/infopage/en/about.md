# About JasonSearch

JasonSearch is a [metasearch engine], aggregating the results of other
{{link('search engines', 'preferences')}} while not storing information about
its users. JasonSearch is a unique and completely independent fork of SearxNG. 

JasonSearch has its own index on numerous news sites marginalized by the mainstream
media to ensure fairness and accuracy of search results.

JasonSearch is managed by a single developer : Jason Nobles.

## Why use it?

- JasonSearch may not offer you as personalized results as Google, but it doesn't
  generate a profile about you.
- JasonSearch doesn't care about what you search for, never shares anything with a
  third-party, and it can't be used to compromise you.
- JasonSearch is built on SearxNG which is free software, the code is 100% open, and everyone is welcome to
  make it better.

If you do care about privacy, want to be a conscious user, or otherwise believe
in digital freedom, make JasonSearch your default search engine or run your own 
instance of SearxNG or JasonSearch on your
own server!


## How does it work?

JasonSearch is a fork of SearXNG. SearxNG is a fork from the well-known Searx metasearch engine which was
inspired by the Seeks Project.  It provides basic privacy by mixing your
queries with searches on other platforms without storing search data.


## How can I make it my own?


JasonSearch appreciates your concern regarding logs, so take the code from the github repository and run it yourself!
The only way to be sure no one is tracking you is to run the application on your own server.
